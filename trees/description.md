A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/chile relationship
Trees are non-linear unlike lists.
But singly linked list can be thought of as a special case of tree.
Root --> The top node in a tree
Child --> A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
Parent --> The converse notion of a child
Siblings --> A group of nodes with the same parent.
Leaf --> A node with no child.
Edge --> The connection between one node and another
Binary tree --> A node can have at most 2 children
Binary Search Tree(BST) --> A sorted Binary Tree
