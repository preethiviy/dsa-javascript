Binary Heap --> Very similar to BST, but with some different rules.
It is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.
In MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
In MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.
